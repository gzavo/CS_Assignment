In this plot we can see a growing trend in both the WO and the Beer consumption per year. Sadly since the scales are so different the growth is not very visible.
It looks like there might be some correlation, but it is very unclear whether this might be due to chance or if there is a causality effect. 
The second plot gives more insight onto possible correlations. The data is plotted against each other, without regards to the year. These plots and the data are not sufficient to answer the question of correlation.
