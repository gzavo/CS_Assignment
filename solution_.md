## Beer Consumption
![Beer Consumption](plot.png)

In the graph above the difference in beer consumption of the world vs The Netherlands is visible. The scales are different to get a better view for the possible presence of correlation. Up to about 2013 no large correlation is visible, after 2013 both the consumption in the world and in The Netherlands seem to grow exponentially. This can hint at a large correlation between the two.
