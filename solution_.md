 ![Correlation Plot](thereisnocorrelation.png)

 The data as shown in the plot attempts to show a correlation between the alcohol consumption and number of students in The Netherlands. Even if one were to neglect fluctuations in the correlation, this data may very well be circumstancial. It would likely be more effective if there was data available on alcohol consumption of specific age groups/ stores. Such as those in proximity to universities.
