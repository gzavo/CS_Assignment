As can be observed in the plot there is a loose correlation betwee the ammount of beer drunk in the netherlands (orange) and the ammount of students (blue), specifically that as the ammount of students goes up the ammount of beer drunk follows. However it seems that while the ammount of students increased with nearly 50% from 200 -> 300 the ammount of beer drunk has risen less going from 11400 -> 12000 hectoliters. This Could indicate that the average student drinks relatively less beer, or it could be that the society of beer drinkers who aren't students drink less compared to measurements in 2006.
