This plot shows the growth of both 
- the number of students in WO in the NL
- the quantity of consumed beer in the Netherlands

across 2006-2018.

>&emsp; I divided the values by their minimum so they are plotted on the same scale, I imagine there's a better looking way to do that and would love to have your thoughts.
The results seem to indicate that the growing student population in WO in the netherlands has little to no direct impact on total beer consumption in the country.
