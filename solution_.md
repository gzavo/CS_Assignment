## Visualization of University Students and Beer Consumption in the Netherlands

![Students vs Beer](students_vs_beer.png)

This plot shows the number of university students (WO) and national beer consumption in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018.  

The figure shows that the number of students steadily increased, while the beer consumption remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend.  
This suggests that the correlation between students and beer consumption may be coincidental rather than causal.
