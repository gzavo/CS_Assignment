![](istherecorrelation.png "Correlation between the number of WO students and consumption of beer in the Netherlands")

From the plot, we can see, that there might be a correlation between the number of WO students and the beer consumption in the Netherlads. This being said, we need to be very careful before jumping to a conclusion and we should take intp consideration that this might just be a coincidence and there are many other factors that might have resulted in higher beer consumption over the years than simply the fact that there are more students. On the other hand, we have to admit that VIA and their 50 cents Thursday beer is doing great job in keeping the consumption up.
