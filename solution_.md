Interpretation on the data: A correlation of 0.8181 is considered as a very strong correlation, even though during the years 2010-2015 the NL Beer consumption had a slight decrease compared to the other years. Looking at the distribution of the data points, the year 2018 on the top right of the plot can be considered as an outlier, as in that year the NL Beer consumption peaked about 12000 X1000 hectoliter even though the number of WO students was also the highest of all other years.
