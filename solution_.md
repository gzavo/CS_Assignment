## Plot from the dataset "istherecorrelation.csv", with DPI=300. 
![Scatter Plot of WO vs. NL Beer Consumption](no_correlation_plot.png)

### Plot interpretation 
The scatter plot shows the relationship between 'WO [x1000]' and 'NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]'.
There is no clear linear correlation between these two variables, as the points are scattered without a clear trend.
