Even tough the correlation between the two timeseries is high more than 0.81, inspecting the plot, it seems there is a lagged effect between the effect of a new school on the annual beer consumption (if we accept the causality between the two variables).
After 2010 the number of WOs starts to increase sharply, while this effect can be only observed after 2013 in the beer consumption.
In order to quantify the forementioned lagged effect, an ARMA model should be fitted to the samples.
