## Plot
![Plot showing correlation students/beer](correlation_plot.png)

The image shows that the two lines (the blue representing the number of students, the red one showing the amount of beer consumed) moved in the same direction between 2006 and 2018. The fact that both amounts increase in the time of interest is proof of correlation between the two variables; of course, this cannot be interpreted as causation.
