## 5 Making a graph of data

![correlation figure](istherecorrelation.jpg)


In the graph we can see the data of number of WO student and beer consumption in the Netherlands during the time period 2006-2018. While there is an upward trend visible for both variables, we can't say correlation exists between them in this time frame. While beer consumption stagnated between 2008 and 2014, the number of students was rising. If there would be a strong correlation alcohol consumption should increase in this time period as well. <br>
Interesting to note would be that in 2014 the legal drinking age went from 16 to 18. Mostly people that are 18 years old will start at WO, and from 2014 and onwards this would be their first time to legally drink, which might be connected to the increase in alcohol consumption from 2014.
