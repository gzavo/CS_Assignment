## Is there correlation?
![istherecorrelationimg](student_beer.png)
By plotting beer consumption in the Netherlands against the number of WO level students we see a linear~ish relationship. A regression line has also been added. From the number of data we have it is hard to tell if there is a correlation, althoug there is evidence for it. The bigger question is whether the two are causated or not, i.e. is the larger beer consumption caused by the larger number of students in a given year? Or vise versa?
