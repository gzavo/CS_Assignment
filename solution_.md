# Is there correleation plot

The dark blue line corresponds to 'WO [x1000]' and the green light corresponds to 'NL beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]'. The WO has a linear increase, while the NL beer consumption experiences a exponential growth from the year 2012. We can conclude that seems to be a correlation between WO and NL beer consumption as they both grow over the whole time period.
