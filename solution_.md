## Data Interpretation
The following plot was made with the provided csv file. It shows the amount of education completion on a university level plotted against the amount of beer consumption in the Netherlands. 

Both show rising trends, however eduction completions rises faster than beer consumption. Obviously this means that the two variables are correlated. However there must be other variables at stake here influencing the faster rise of education completion compared to beer consumption. To see why education completion is rising faster than beer consumption, we must conduct further research to control for this omitted variable bias.
