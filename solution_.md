![WO vs Beer](plot.png "WO vs Beer")

The plot suggests a correlation between the amount of WO students in the netherlands and the beer consumption, as the number of students rises, beer consumption also increases. However the plot can also be slightly misleading, as student numbers grew by nearly 50%, beer consumption rose only by 600hl. It can also be reflecting the change of drinking habits among the students, that being, that they drink proportionally less.
