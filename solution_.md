Plot description:
The plot shows the amount of beer consumption from 2006 to 2018 both for WO (university students in The Netherlands) as well as total NL consumption.
It can be seen the plots have a similar behaviour, with beer consumption having a general increasing trend. However, total NL beer consumption shows a slight decrease from 2009 to 2012, while WO beer consumption lowered from 2012 to 2013.
After 2013, the consumption for both groups had a steady increase.
