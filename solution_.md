The above plot shows the progression of the nr. of WO students in the Netherlands compared to nation wide beer consumption. While both plots show a trend upwards, this is not enough to draw the conclusion that there is a correlation. These plots do not provide sufficient data. A more valuable comparison would be if we considered the size of the entire Dutch population and checked whether the relative increase to beer consumption corresponds to the relative increase in WO students.
