![WO Enrollments & NL Beer Consumption Over the Years](Correlation_Plot.png)

The plot shows the trends in WO enrollments and NL beer consumption over the years from 2006 to 2018. Both datasets show an upward trend, indicating a general increase over time. The beer consumption exhibits a more pronounced rise from 2014 onwards, whereas the growth in WO enrollments is more linear and steady throughout the period. Without further in-depth analysis, it's not possible to conclude any direct relationship between these two variables.
