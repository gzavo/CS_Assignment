This plot shows the normalized (scaled to 0-1 range) data of WO diplomas vs Beer consumption in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018. 
They do show some correlation but there is a period of divergence in the midddle of the plot before the two go back to similar upward movements.
Generally both variables have seen a strong increase over the timespan and show signs of correlation. However, to determine whether there is causation will require further research.
