Thirteen years of Dutch beer consumption in hectoliters is shown along with two different regressors fit to the observed data. A linear *and* third order polynomial were fitted to the data. While there is high correlation ($R^{2}=0.99$) with the third order polynomial, such a correlation is certainly suspect and with such a small window of data, the polynomial regressor is likely overfit to the data. The linear regressor, however, shows substantially weaker correlation of $R^{2}=0.68$, which is to be expected since the Dutch drinking habits appear to be non-linear. 95% confidence intervals are shown for the best fit lines to the data.
