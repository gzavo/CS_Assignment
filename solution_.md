3. **DW Ziegler et al., 2005**

### CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
   - The scatter plot shows the relationship between the two variables
   - The red dashed line is represents the linear trend
   - Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures the linear relationship strength:
     * a r close to +1 means a strong positive correlation --> we have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.818.
   - P-value indicates statistical significance (< 0.05 typically considered significant) --> we have a P-value of 0.001.
