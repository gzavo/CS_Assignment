Given the data, we find a correlation of $r = 0.82$, indicating that higher numbers of WO students are associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption. However, this result should be taken with a grain of salt, since Pearson's r assumes the data is linear. In our case, this only holds for the lower half of the data. After the midpoint, it seems to follow more of an exponential distribution.
