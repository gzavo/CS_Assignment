## Plot
![Scatter Plot](myplot.png)
The scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation between the number of university graduates (WO [x1000]) and Dutch beer consumption (in thousands of hectoliters). This suggests that as the number of graduates increased, beer consumption also tended to rise, although causation cannot be inferred from this correlation.
