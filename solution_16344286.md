## Plot
![Consumption of beer among WO graduates in the 2006 2018 period](https://github.com/fsedawd03/CS_Assignment_16344286/Consumption%20of%20beer%20among%20WO%20graduates%20in%20the%202006-2018%20period.png)

In the plot above we can observe that there is a possible non-linear correlation between the number of WO graduates and the beer 
consumption in the NL during the 2006-2018 period, with a significant increase in the last 7 years.

More specifically an increase of more than 15% in WO graduates and an increase of almost 5% of beer consumption
