## Plot
![Consumption of beer in NL vs People with a WO-level education (2006-2018)](https://github.com/fsedawd03/CS_Assignment_16344286/blob/main/Consumption%20of%20beer%20in%20NL%20vs%20People%20with%20a%20WO-level%20education%20(2006-2018).png)

In the plot above we can observe that there is a possible non-linear correlation between the number of WO graduates and the beer 
consumption in the NL during the 2006-2018 period, with a significant increase in the last 7 years.

More specifically an increase of more than 15% in WO graduates and an increase of almost 5% of beer consumption
