This plot shows the number of students enrolled in WO (Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs) education versus the beer consumption in hectoliters between 2006 and 2018. The plot shows an overall positive relationship between the two variables. While the earlier years show some fluctuations, the beer consumption increases as the number of students rises, with a particularly sharp increase observed in the later years.
