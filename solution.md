The bar graph above depicts the annual beer consumption in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018. The unit is 1000 hectoliter. From 2008 to 2013, the yearly assumption stayed relatively constant at 11500. But in 2014, there seemed to be an uptick. From that point on, the annual consumption rose by 1000 every year. 2018 saw the peak, which measured more than 12,000 x 1000 hectolitres. To ascertain the trend, data from the years that follow are required: did consumption peak in 2018 or did it keep rising after then?
