### Analysis of WO and NL Beer Consumption Data

#### 1. **WO [x1000]**:
- **Trend**: 
  - The WO values have generally been increasing over the years.
  - Started from `205.9` in 2006 and reached `280.1` in 2018.
  
- **Notable Observations**: 
  - There's a noticeable jump between 2009 and 2010, where the value increased from `220.5` to `233.2`.
  - The highest increase in consecutive years is between 2016 and 2017, with a rise of `6.7`.
  
- **Extremes**: 
  - Lowest: `205.9` in 2006.
  - Highest: `280.1` in 2018.

#### 2. **NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]**:
- **Trend**: 
  - Beer consumption has been on a general upward trend.
  - Started from `11,402` in 2006 to `12,048` in 2018.
  
- **Notable Observations**: 
  - The largest increase in consecutive years is between 2016 and 2017, with a rise of `131`.
  - The smallest increase is between 2007 and 2008, with an increment of `42`.
  
- **Extremes**: 
  - Lowest: `11,402` in 2006.
  - Highest: `12,048` in 2018.

#### 3. **Correlation**:
- Both WO and NL Beer consumption values have been increasing over the years, suggesting a positive correlation. 
- **Caution**: Correlation does not imply causation.
- The years where WO saw significant jumps (e.g., between 2009 and 2010), the beer consumption did not necessarily have a corresponding large increase.
