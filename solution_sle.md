Figure 1. Beer consumption in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2018. Beer consumption remained relatively constant between years 2006 and 2013, until 2014 when there was a substantial increase in the rate of consumption of beer. The trendline for WO consumption is linear and altogether negligible in comparisont to beer consumption in that time period, which appears to be exponential.
