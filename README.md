# Computational Scientist's Toolbox Assignment

This repository contains a pdf conversion of the presented slides, in case you missed anything during the lecture.

To complete the lecture, carry out the following tasks (i.e., homework):

1. Create a free GitHub account if you don't already have one.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Create a markdown (.md) named "solution_<your name>.md" file that will contain the following:
4. Your studentID!
5. The title of the following papers pivotal to our knowledge:
  - MCC Van Dyke et al., 2019
  - JT Harvey, Applied Ergonomics, 2002
  - DW Ziegler et al., 2005
5. Create one plot from the dataset "istherecorrelation.csv", with DPI=300. The objective is to visualize the data in a way that you consider representative. Include the resulting plot image in the markdown file and add a few lines of interpretation on the data.
6. Commit and push these two files to your fork.
7. Create a pull request for me to this (the original) repo. (Hint: you can use the "New pull request" button and then do a "compare across forks").
8. You are done, I will see the pull requests and check your work.
