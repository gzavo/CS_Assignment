## Data Analysis

Here we present the correlation between university enrollment and beer consumption in the Netherlands.

Let's compare them singularly:
- ### The University enrollment trend:
    There is a clear up-trend from 2006 to 2018. The number of students     increased from about 2'050'000 to 2'800'000, representing an overall growth of approximately 36%.
    
- ### The beer consumption trend: 
    Beer consumption in the Netherlands also shows an upward trend starting from 2012, with an exponential growth. Before 2012 it seems like the consumption was stable and had small variations during the years. From 2012 to 2018 the number of hectoliters consumed grew from 11'450'000 to 12'000'00, an increase of about 5%. We can approximate the average growth from 2006 to 2018 as the same by looking at the plot.

<br>
The first conclusion we can come up with is the fact that the plot is misleading: this is because of a different scale in the two datasets. In fact, even if the beer consuption growth looks faster, the average growth of the university enrollments is 7 times more. <br> <br>
This takes us to the next conclusion, regarding the correlation of the two phenomena. There is a positive correlation between them, especially in the last year taken into consideration, however, since their growth is different (both numerically and visually), it is likely that there are other factor having more weight on the trends.
