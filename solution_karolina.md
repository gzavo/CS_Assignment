## Papers:
1) MCC Van Dyke et al., 2019 <br>
Title: "*The Rise of Coccidioides: Forces Against the Dust Devil Unleashed*" or "*Fantastic yeasts and where to find them: the hidden diversity of dimorphic fungal pathogens*". In my opinion it could be both since the name of the scientific jurnal is not mentioned. <br />
2) JT Harvey, Applied Ergonomics, 2002 <br>
Title: "*An analysis of the forces required to drag sheep over various surfaces*" <br />
3) DW Ziegler et al., 2005 <br>

## Data visualisation

The file "*istherecorrelation.csv*" contains data on alcohol consumption in the Netherlands and the number of WO students, both for the years 2006 to 2018. The data on alcohol consumption is given in hectoliters. I plotted the data on one graph, but included two y-axes to account for the different units. The data on alcohol consumption in the Netherlands does not indicate consumption among students, nor does the number of students influence alcohol consumption. While it is possible that a relationship exists, it cannot be verified based on the available data. Considering the lack of evident influence of one dataset on the other, the data should be interpreted separately.  <br>

The number of students in recent years has increased. This growth is also visible in the number of hectoliters of alcohol consumption since 2012. However, this does not necessarily mean that people are drinking more; it may also be influenced by the growing population.
