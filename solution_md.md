### Data Analysis Plot of `istherecorrelation.csv`

![Correlation Plot](correlation.png)

The first subplot displays both beer consumption and the number of WO students. Based on the y-axis scaling in this plot, it may appear that there is a correlation between the number of students and beer consumption. However, the second subplot, with corrected y-axis scaling, demonstrates that this is a misleading conclusion. The third subplot, which shows beer consumption per student, reveals a negative trend, further supporting the conclusion from the second plot. This provides clear evidence that the first plot, due to its scaling, leads to a false impression of a correlation between student numbers and beer consumption.
