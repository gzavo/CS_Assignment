![Beer Consumption per Student Over the Years](plot.png)

* Please refer to work.ipynb file for the code behind the plot.

## Interpretation

Although we can initally see that there is an increase in beer consumption by WO students in istherecorrelation.csv dataset, we can also see that there has been an increase of WO students over the years. When we divide beer consumption by number of students each year, we can see that the amount that each student is drinking each year is generally decreasing.
