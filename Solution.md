*Figure 1: Scatter plot showing the relationship between "WO [x1000]" and "NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]" for different years. 
The blue dots represent individual data points, each labeled with the corresponding year. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is 0.8180643555130895.*

The graph shows that across the years, the correlation between WO and NL Beer consumption, measured by the Pearson coefficient increases. This suggests a positive linear relationship between these two variables. As WO increases, NL Beer consumption tends to increase as well.
