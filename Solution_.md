The plot presented above suggests that there is a corelation between those variables. This can be verified statisticly with pearsonr function in scipy, the pearson coefficient is equal to 0.82 and p-value is approximately 6*10^-4, therepfre we can assume that there is a correlation based on those results. Of course, correlation does not imply causality.
