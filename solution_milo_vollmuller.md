![Plot of amount of WO students vs NL Beer consumption per year](plot_milo_vollmuller.png)

In this plot is visible the amount of dutch university students and the beer consumption in the 
Netherlands. Both trends are positive, but there does not seem to be a very direct correlation 
between the two, because when the amount of students went down in 2013, the beer consumption 
still went up. Both trends are likely to be tied with population growth, so there is no proof
that the two factors are actually correlated.
